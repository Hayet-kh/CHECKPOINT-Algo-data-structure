Data Structures and Algorithms Exploration

# Overview

    This checkpoint aims to enhance understanding of various data structures and algorithms through interactive visualizations. Utilizing the resource Visualgo, users can explore and test different algorithms and data structures in a hands-on manner.

# Instructions

    1. Visit Visualgo:
    Go to Visualgo to access a wealth of interactive visualizations for data structures and algorithms.

    2. Explore:
    Test and try out the interactive schemes of each data structure and sorting algorithm available on the site.

    3. Reflect:
    As you explore, take note of any data structures and sorting algorithms that you are not yet familiar with.

    4. Document: Create a list that includes:
        - The names of the data structures and sorting algorithms you find challenging or unfamiliar.
        - A brief explanation of why you feel you haven't mastered them yet.

    5. Share: Once you have compiled your list, share it with your instructor for further discussion and guidance.

# Goals

    - Improve understanding of fundamental and advanced data structures.
    - Gain hands-on experience with sorting algorithms and their efficiencies.
    - Identify areas for further study and practice.

# Conclusion

By utilizing Visualgo, we can deepen our comprehension of how various data structures and algorithms function. This exploration will not only bolster our programming skills but also prepare us for more complex computational problems in the future.
