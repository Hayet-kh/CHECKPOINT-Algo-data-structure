AFTER EXPLORING VISUALGO, Here are a few data structures and sorting algorithms that I came across which I’m not very familiar with yet:

# Data Structures

    1. B-Trees
        Why I’m Not Familiar: I’ve heard of B-Trees being used in databases for efficient data retrieval, but I haven’t actually dived into how they work.

    2. Tries (Prefix Trees)
        Why I’m Not Familiar: I know tries are great for searching strings quickly, especially for things like autocomplete features. However, I haven’t had time yet to implement one.

# Sorting Algorithms

    1. Heap Sort
        Why I’m Not Familiar: I’ve read about heaps, but I’ve never implemented heap sort myself.

    2. Tim Sort
    Why I’m Not Familiar: I’ve learned that Tim Sort is used in Python and Java because of its efficiency, but I haven’t dug into how it works in detail. Understanding the mechanics behind its hybrid approach would be really helpful for my programming toolkit.

Overall, exploring Visualgo helped to understand some new concepts, and I’m looking forward to mastering these data structures and algorithms in the future!
